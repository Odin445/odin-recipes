    <p>Baked ziti is a comforting, crowd-pleasing Italian-American dish that combines tender pasta, rich marinara sauce, and melted cheese, all baked to perfection. The ziti pasta is coated in a savory tomato sauce, often mixed with ricotta cheese for extra creaminess, and topped with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan. Once baked, the dish forms a golden, bubbly crust on top, while the inside remains warm, cheesy, and flavorful. Perfect for family dinners or gatherings, baked ziti is a hearty, satisfying meal that offers a perfect balance of savory, cheesy goodness with each 
        bite.</p><br>
