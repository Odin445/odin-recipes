        <p>Minestrone casserole is a hearty and comforting dish that combines the rich, savory flavors of a traditional minestrone soup with the satisfying texture of a baked casserole. This dish typically features a blend of fresh vegetables such as carrots, celery, tomatoes, and spinach, along with hearty beans and pasta, all simmered in a flavorful broth.
